# oscp-stuff

A simple collection of things I found useful, but was too lazy to do before now. 


I have my little black book of CPPT, CEH (believe it or not), PNPT, and OSCP stuff that I really like using.  Going to be adding them here.


Enjoy and always work so diligently and hard that no one can use that stupid trope of "try harder".
