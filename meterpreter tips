### Meterpreter ### 
# definitely a good tool to use professionally, anyone who trys to sell you that pentesters don't use frameworks and do everything manually is full of shit

#### add a port forward ####

# set up route to newly discovered subnet
msf> run autoroute -s 10.4.16.0/23

# set up port forward
msf> portfwd add -l 1234 10.4.7.27 80

# to translate ... create a portforward, using local port 1234, for the destination host or 10.4.7.27 with destination port 80
